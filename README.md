# cgull's Hades Mods

I have made a number of mods for Hades by SuperGiant Games, a game I greatly enjoy and encourage everyone to play! Mods I have made include:

- A "Randomizer" mod allowing for random enemies and items in the game.
- Challenge mods for new files, and the Barge of Death.
- Contributed to modpacks for the Hades Speedrunning Leaderboard and community tournaments.

And many others! You can check out a collection of my mods [here](https://github.com/cgullsHadesMods).
